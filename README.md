# JAVASCRIPT
This repo consists of interview preperation notes on JS.

In other languages PRIMITIVE data types are stoed in stack and reference datat types are stored in heap. In JS both are stored in an object called variable object in which the primitive data type value is stored directly and for reference data type the pointer to the memory location is stored in the variable object.

Primitive Types:
Boolean -- true or false
Number-- Any integer or floating-point numeric value
String --A character or sequence of characters delimited 
by either single or double quotes (JavaScript has no 
separate character type)
Null-- A primitive type that has only one value, null
Undefined --A primitive type that has only one value, undefined
(undefined is the value assigned to a variable that is not 
initialized)
